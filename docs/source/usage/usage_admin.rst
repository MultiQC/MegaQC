MegaQC Usage: Administration
============================

Initial setup
-------------

Once you have your MegaQC server up and running, load up the address in
your web browser. The MegaQC installation creates an empty database
without any registered users. The first user to register will
automatically be an administrator, so make sure that you immediately
register!

User administration
-------------------

Admins have access to a page in the navigation called *Administration
Panel* where you can create, delete and reset passwords for other MegaQC
users.
