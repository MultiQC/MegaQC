# MegaQC Usage: Administration

## Initial setup
Once you have your MegaQC server up and running, load up the address in your web
browser. The MegaQC installation creates an empty database without any registered
users. The first user to register will automatically be an administrator, so make
sure that you immediately register!

## User administration
Admins have access to a page in the navigation called _Administration Panel_ where
you can create, delete and reset passwords for other MegaQC users.
