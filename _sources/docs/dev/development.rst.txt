The following sections are aimed at developers trying to contribute to MegaQC.

.. TODO I would love to point people to a contributions guidelines section or something. 
.. Maybe this file here actually is just that and we should just rename it accordingly? :)

Please follow the :ref:`installation_dev` guidelines to install a development ready version of MegaQC.
You should also be aware of the detailed :ref:`megaqc_module` and :ref:`megaqc_api_reference`.
Next, some technical details regarding the front and backend are explained.
